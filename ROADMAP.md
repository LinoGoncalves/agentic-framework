# Agentic Framework - Development Roadmap

## 🎯 Context Window Management & Large Codebase Scaling

### **Problem Statement**
As projects scale to enterprise-level codebases (100k+ lines, complex architectures, multi-team coordination), the shared context window model faces potential drift issues that could impact agent effectiveness and project continuity.

### **Strategic Approach**
Preserve the current shared context + Human-in-the-Loop design while implementing intelligent context management to handle large-scale projects without architectural disruption.

### **Deliverables:**
- ✅ **Context Management Protocol** added to `master-agent.md`
- ✅ **Hierarchical Context Architecture** implementation
- ✅ **Phase Transition Summaries** templates and procedures
- ✅ **Decision Registry** system for tracking human approvals
- ⏳ **Context Pruning Guidelines** for agents

### **Technical Implementation:**
```
Enhanced Master Agent Features:
├── Context compression protocols
├── Phase transition management
├── Decision tracking system
└── Context relevance prioritization
```

### **Success Metrics:**
- Context window utilization stays below 80% on medium projects
- Zero critical decision loss during phase transitions

## 🎯 **Success Criteria & KPIs**

### **Phase 1 Success Metrics:**
- [ ] Context window efficiency >80% on large projects
- [ ] Zero decision loss during transitions
- [ ] Human approval workflow <30 seconds
- [ ] Agent consistency score >95%

### **Overall Framework Goals:**
- **Scalability**: Handle enterprise codebases (500k+ lines)
- **Performance**: Maintain response quality regardless of project size
- **Usability**: Zero disruption to Human-in-the-Loop workflows
- **Reliability**: 99.9% context integrity across project lifecycle

## 🔧 **Implementation Notes**

### **Design Principles:**
1. **Preserve HITL Model**: All context management requires human approval
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing projects remain unaffected
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Features can be adopted incrementally
4. **Zero Workflow Disruption**: Enhancements are transparent to users

### **Quality Gates:**
- Each phase requires successful completion before proceeding
- Human validation of all context management decisions
- Performance benchmarking against baseline framework
- User acceptance testing with real enterprise projects
