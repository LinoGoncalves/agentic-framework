- Standard user story creation and acceptance criteria definition

### **Escalation Required**
Human oversight needed for:
- Budget impact decisions over defined threshold
- Timeline commitments affecting project milestones
- Scope changes requiring additional resources
- Stakeholder conflict resolution beyond standard patterns
- Regulatory interpretation requiring legal consultation

### **Escalation Protocols**
```
ESCALATION LEVEL 1 - Supervisor Review:
- Scope changes with minor budget/timeline impact
- Stakeholder preference conflicts
- Technical feasibility questions
- Priority conflicts between stakeholders

ESCALATION LEVEL 2 - Management Decision:
- Significant scope changes
- Budget threshold exceedance
- Timeline commitment impacts
- Cross-functional coordination decisions

ESCALATION LEVEL 3 - Executive Approval:
- Strategic direction changes
- Major budget reallocations
- Timeline extensions requiring client communication
- Regulatory compliance interpretations
```
