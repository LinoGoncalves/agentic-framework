### **Escalation Protocols****Usage**: This template should be customized for each project's specific domain requirements while maintaining the generic framework structure.



#### **Domain Expert Unavailable****Integration**: Works with existing Human-AI collaboration model by adding domain expert validation layer.

1. **Document the domain question** with full context

2. **Research authoritative sources** (academic papers, industry standards)**Scalability**: Framework supports multiple domain experts for complex multi-domain projects.
3. **Implement conservative approach** with clear documentation of assumptions
4. **Flag for domain expert review** when available
5. **Create validation test cases** for future expert verification

#### **Domain Expert Disagreement**
1. **Document both perspectives** with rationale
2. **Research additional authoritative sources**
3. **Implement most conservative approach** that satisfies safety requirements
4. **Schedule resolution meeting** with additional domain expertise if needed
5. **Document final decision** and reasoning for future reference
