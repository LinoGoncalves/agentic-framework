# Development Standards

The Agentic Framework includes comprehensive development standards following VS Code and GitHub best practices.

## üìÅ Location: `.github/development_standards/`

All development standards are now located in the `.github/development_standards/` directory, following official VS Code and GitHub recommendations for project structure.

## ü§ñ VS Code Integration

### Automatic Recognition
- **`.github/copilot-instructions.md`** - VS Code Copilot automatically recognizes and applies these coding guidelines
- **`.github/chatmodes/Master Agent.md`** - Custom chat mode available in VS Code's chat interface
- **`.github/development_standards/`** - Professional repository structure following industry standards

### Using with VS Code Copilot
1. VS Code automatically finds `.github/copilot-instructions.md` in your project
2. Coding guidelines are applied to all Copilot suggestions
3. Custom chat modes appear in the VS Code chat mode dropdown
4. Development standards are easily discoverable and maintainable
